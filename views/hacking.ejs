        </b>
        <p> If you are planning to download a music file, video or a utility software do so from a trusted website. Many

        </b>
        <p>
          Email is one of the biggest tools through which hackers spread malware. The spyware or virus are hidden in
          attachments and links clicking on which the infection begins. Hence, never click on random attachments if
          those
          are not from any trusted source.

          remove
          any kind of malware.

        </p>
