        <h1 class="centered">7 Primary reasons businesses like yours are at serious risk of Cybercrime</h1>
        <br><br>
        <p>
          <b>1) You doubt It Can’t Happen To You –</b> Smaller businesses have this habit of presuming that because they
          are not a multi-million or multi-billion company, an attacker would have no interest in stopping or
          distributing malwares into their systems or even worse steal their data. It very convenient for a
          hackers to successfully target <i>"Small and Medium-sized Businesses"</i> that has invested very little in
          Cybersecurity,
          allowing them use your business to practice their craft and possibly make profit off of your stolen data. The
          newest malware variants are automated to target businesses that lacks protection from a particular
          vulnerability.
        </p>
        <p><b>2) Your Staff Isn’t Updated With latest Security Best Practices –</b> Your employees are your best defense
          and at same time your biggest weakness. Almost, if not all the cybercrimes are dependent on your worker's
          ignorance
          to take place. if you dont secure your data, criminals can target you through ransomeware attacks by for
          example,
          encrypting all the data on their hard drive and demanding money to send the encryption key. So, If your staff
          isn’t
          well grounded on security best practices and or undergone training and assessment to keep them up to date,
          then
          any number of threats can get to your business with ease.</p>

        <p><b>3) Exposed to Different Attacks From Different Directions –</b> Security Applications will only proctect
          you from some
          kinds of attacks. If your security measures and protocols don’t take into account email, web browsing
          behaviors,
          file sharing, and network activity, your defenses won’t hold up under Some many attacks fron different
          directions.
        </p>

        <p><b>4) Threats Change Everyday –</b> Malwares and other cyber threats regularly change like every other thing
          in Technology. Hackers are persistently devising new ways to exploit your data,
          businesses and/or harm your devices, and are creating more sophisticated threats. If you are not updated on
          the latest
          malware, you very much vulnerable to their attacks. This level of vigilance is all but impossible to achieve
          without
          full-time IT security staff at your disposal.</p>

        <p><b>5) Your Policies And Protocols Are Lacking –</b> Your policies need to focus on more than just password
          control. At the minimum, you should have two-factor authentication and access controls in place to
          protect mission-critical data. By tightly regulating access to your files, folders, and systems, you
          can reduce the odds of an unauthorized users getting their hands on your data or finding a way inside
          your network.</p>

        <p><b>6) You’ve Got Lackluster Data Backup Practices –</b> The most terrifying malware infection to date has
          been
          ransomware, and no other infection makes a better case for the importance of data backups. Without current
          and complete backups available for your business to restore from – specifically offsite backups that are
          insulated from threats that target your network and systems – it’s next to impossible to survive a ransomware
          attack. Businesses that don’t have reliable and up to date data backups to count on will typically close their
          doors within six months of a major data loss incident.</p>

        <p><b>7) Your Systems And Software Are Out Of Date –</b> An alarming number of malware infections — including
          the
          now-infamous WannaCry ransomware virus — use pre-existing system or software exploits to gain access to
          targeted systems. More often than not, security experts are aware these exploits exist, and release patches
          and updates designed to rectify the problem long before a hacker figures out how to make use of said exploit.
          However, if you’re not keeping on top of these patches and updates, you’re essentially propping a door open
          for a cybercriminal to waltz right through.</p>

        <h1 class="centered">More Tips</h1>
        <br><br>
        <p>
          <b>1) Check links before clicking them –</b> Smaller businesses have this habit of presuming that because they
          are not a multi-million or multi-billion company, an attacker would have no interest in stopping or
          distributing malwares into their systems or even worse steal their data. It very convenient for a
          hackers to successfully target <i>"Small and Medium-sized Businesses"</i> that has invested very little in

          newest malware variants are automated to target businesses that lacks protection from a particular
          vulnerability.
        </p>
        <p><b>2) Check email addresses from the received email –</b> Your employees are your best defense
          and at same time your biggest weakness. Almost, if not all the cybercrimes are dependent on your worker's
          ignorance
          to take place. if you dont secure your data, criminals can target you through ransomeware attacks by for
          example,
          encrypting all the data on their hard drive and demanding money to send the encryption key. So, If your staff
          isn’t
          well grounded on security best practices and or undergone training and assessment to keep them up to date,
          then
          any number of threats can get to your business with ease.</p>

        <p><b>3) Use common sense before sending sensitive information. If a request seems odd, it probably is. It’s
            better to check
            via a phone call with the person in question before actioning the “request” –</b> Security Applications will
          only
          proctect you from some kinds of attacks. If your security measures and protocols don’t take into account
          email,
          web browsing behaviors, file sharing, and network activity, your defenses won’t hold up under Some many
          attacks
          fron different directions.
        </p>

        <p><b>4) Backup your data –</b> In the event of a disaster (often a cyber attack) you must have your data backed
          up to avoid
          serious downtime, loss of data and serious financial loss.
        </p>

        <p><b>5) Ensure Endpoint Protection –</b> Endpoint protection protects networks that are remotely bridged to
          devices. Mobile
          devices, tablets and laptops that are connected to corporate networks give access paths to security threats.
          These
          paths need protected with specific endpoint protection software.</p>

        <p><b>6) Install a Firewall –</b> There are so many different types of sophisticated data breaches and new ones
          surface every
          day and even make a much Stronger comebacks. Putting your network behind a firewall is one of the most
          effective ways
          to defend yourself from any cyber attack. A firewall system will block any brute force attacks made on your
          network
          and/or systems before it can do any damage, something we can help you with.
        </p>

        <p><b>7) Control access to your systems –</b> Believe it or not, one of the attacks that you can receive on your
          systems can
          be physical, having control over who can access your network is really really important. Somebody can simply
          walk into
          your office or enterprise and plug in a USB key containing infected files into one of your computers allowing
          them
          access to your entire network or infect it It’s essential to control who has access to your computers. Having
          a
          perimeter security system installed is a very good way to stop cybercrime as much as break ins!</p>
        <p>
          <b>8) Wifi Security –</b> Who doesn’t have a wifi enabled device in 2020? And that’s exactly the danger, any
          device
          can get infected by connecting to a network, if this infected device then connects to your business network
          your entire system is at serious risk. Securing your wifi networks and hiding them is one of the safest things
          you can do for you systems. With developing more and more everyday there’s thousands of devices that can
          connect
          to your network and compromise you.
        </p>
        <p><b>9) Employee personal accounts –</b> Every employee needs their own login for every application and
          program. Several users
          connecting under the same credentials can put your business at risk. Having separate logins for each staff
          member
          will help you reduce the number of attack fronts. Users only log in once each day and will only use their own
          set
          of logins. Greater security isn’t the only benefit, you’ll also get improved usability.
        </p>

        <p><b>3) Passwords –</b> Having the same password setup for everything can be dangerous. Once a hacker figures
          out your
          password, they now have access to everything in your system and any application you use. Having different
          passwords
          setup for every application you use is a real benefit to your security, and changing them often will maintain
          a high
          level of protection against external and internal threats.
        </p>

        <p><b>4) Backup your data –</b> In the event of a disaster (often a cyber attack) you must have your data backed
          up to avoid
          serious downtime, loss of data and serious financial loss.
        </p>

        <p><b>5) Ensure Endpoint Protection –</b> Endpoint protection protects networks that are remotely bridged to
