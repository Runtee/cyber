            <h1 class="centered">Malware Attack?</h1>
            <br><br>
            <p>Software which is used with the aim of attempting to breach a computer system’s
              security policy with respect to Confidentiality, Integrity or Availability.
              The term software should here be understood in the broadest sense, as the malicious effect
              may make use of executable code, interpreted code, scripts, macros etc. The computer
              system whose security policy is attempted breached is usually known as the target for
              the malware. We shall use the term the initiator of the malware to denote the subject
              who originally launched the malware with the intent of attacking one or more targets.
              Depending on the type of malware, the set of targets may or may not be explictly known
              to the initiator.
              Note that this definition relates the maliciousness of the software to an attempted
              breach of the target’s security policy. This in turn means that it depends on the privileges
              of the initiator on the target system. A program P which would be classified as malware
              if initiated by an user with no special privileges, could easily be quite acceptable (though
              obviously a potential danger to have lying about) if executed by a system administrator
              with extensive privileges on the target system.

            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Malware Attack Types</h2>
            <p>Malware attack can be in various ways. Here are list of Malwares -</p>
          </div>
          <div class="phishing-types">
            <ul>
              <b>
                <li> Virus -</li>
              </b>
              <p> Malware which spreads from one computer to another by embedding copies of
                itself into files, which by some means or another are transported to the target. The
                medium of transport is often known as the vector of the virus. The transport may
                be initiated by the virus itself (for example, it may send the infected file as an e-mail
                attachment) or rely on an unsuspecting human user (who for example transports a
                CD-ROM containing the infected file).
              </p>
              <br><br>
              <b>
                <li>Worm -</li>
              </b>
              <p> Malware which spreads from one computer to another by transmitting copies of
                itself via a network which connects the computers, without the use of infected files.
              </p>
              <b>
                <li>Trojan horse -</li>
              </b>
              <p>
                Malware which is embedded in a piece of software which has an apparently
                useful effect. The useful effect is often known as the overt effect, as it is made
                apparent to the receiver, while the effect of the malware, known as the covert effect,
                is kept hidden from the receiver.
              </p>
              <b>
                <li>Logic bomb -</li>
              </b>
              <p>Malware which is triggered by some external event, such as the arrival of a
                specific date or time, or the creation or deletion of a specific data item such as a file
                or a database entry.

              </p>
              <b>
                <li>Rabbit -</li>
              </b>
              <p> This is Also known as Bacterium. Malware which uses up all of a particular class of resource,
                such as message buffers, file space or process control blocks, on a computer system.

              </p>
              <b>
                <li>Backdoor -</li>
              </b>
              <p>Malware which, once it reaches the target, allows the initiator to gain access
                to the target without going through any of the normal login and authentication
                procedures.

          <h1 style="text-align: center;">How to prevent Malwares:</h1>
          <p>There are some very specific things you can do as an individual to protect yourself:</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
            <li>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) on any qualifying account</li>
            <li>Use anti-malware programs</li>
            <li>Use firewalls</li>
            <li>Be suspicious of pop-ups and pop-unders</li>
            <li>Be suspicious of email attachments from known and unknown sources</li>
            <li>Be suspicious of text messages or IMs from known and unknown sources that want you
              to click through to some destination or result in a query about your personal information</li>
            <li>Don’t give out your personal information</li>
            <p>Also do the following</p>
            <li>Filter for phishing email and malicious web traffic at the gateway</li>
            <li>Authenticate email senders using Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)
            </li>
            <li>Filter for phishing emails based on sender and content, and analyze URLs and attachments for malicious
              attributes
              using static and dynamic techniques</li>
            <li>Employ advanced filtering techniques that use artificial intelligence (AI) to spot business email
              compromise (BEC)
              and credential-stealing attacks</li>
            <li>Prevent internal phishing attacks with a service-integrated security solution for your cloud or
              on-premises email
              platform using APIs. These are available for Microsoft 365, Google G Suite, Microsoft Exchange Server, and
              IBM
              Domino server</li>
